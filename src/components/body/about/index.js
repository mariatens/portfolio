          <br /> Software Engineer
          <p>
            I am an enthusiastic, perseverant Software Engineer Trainee at
            Academy.
            <br />
            I started my career in tech as an Information Analyst for Public
            Health Scotland after graduating with a First from the University of
            Glasgow, where I learnt about data analysis, statistics and coding
            in R.
            <br />I am passionate about tech for social good and continuous
            learning.
